# 2024_TSsim

TimeScale simulator.  New repository for first chapter of MA thesis from Columbia University.

TSsim contains two core class objects: Simulator and Analysis.  
- Simulator takes as input a phylogenetic tree - the "true" tree - and uses the Python package **ipcoal** to generate simulated genealogies and sequence data across the topology, given user-defined bounds on Ne (effective population size) and g (generation time).  These simulated data are subsequently input to a suite of phylogeny-construction software packages.
- Analysis takes as input the simulated phylogenies generated by Simulator and computes the simple and relative whole-tree error of the input compared to the "true" tree.

The purpose of TSsim is to assess the influence of various confounding factors on the capacity of phylogenetic methods to accurately infer a true topology, which is typically not known for real datasets.  Factors tested include Ne, g, and the placement or volume of calibration nodes.

Call TSsim script:
```bash
tss tree reps --min_NE --max_NE --min_g --max_g --outdir --outprefix --ipcoal_kwargss --chronos_constraints --mb_params --mb_treeagepr --seed
```
